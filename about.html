        We believe every American deserves financial security and peace of mind. 
        Our mission is to make saving simple, empowering individuals and families 
        to build strong emergency funds that protect their well-being in uncertain times. 
        Whether it’s an unexpected medical bill, job loss, or car repair—having a safety net 
        can change everything. We're here to help make that a reality.

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Why We Built This</h2>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Too many Americans live paycheck to paycheck, and saving often feels out of reach.
        We built this platform during a Hackathon to tackle that problem head-on. 
        By making saving intuitive, goal-driven, and accessible, we hope to inspire better habits 
        and long-term security—one emergency fund at a time.
